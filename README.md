# React Native Rate Repository App

We will develop an application to rate GitHub repositories. Our application will have features such as sorting and filtering reviewed repositories, registering a user, logging in, and creating a review for a repository. The back-end of the application will be provided to us so that we can focus solely on developing with React Native.
